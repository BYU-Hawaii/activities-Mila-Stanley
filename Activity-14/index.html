        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite things to do with ChatGPT is ask it to 
            crossbreed all kinds of animals together. On this page I 
            have compiled a collection of some of my favorites. The text
            is generated by ChatGPT, who I refed the images and asked it to describe.

        <h3>Kangaroo-Dog</h3>
        <img src="images/kangaroodog.jpg" alt="an animal that appears to cross a kangaroo and a dog">
        <p>The first animal is a fascinating hybrid of a kangaroo and a dog. 
            Its body has the characteristic shape and posture of a kangaroo, with 
            strong, muscular hind legs, a long tail for balance, and shorter forelimbs. 
            The fur is a mix of browns and whites, with a sleek, short coat typical of many dog 
            breeds. The face, however, is distinctly canine, featuring a dog's snout, expressive eyes, 
            and pointed ears. The combination of these features creates a unique and captivating creature 
            that embodies the agility and strength of a kangaroo with the loyal and friendly demeanor of a dog.</p>
        <h3>Turtle-Duck</h3>
        <img src="images/turtleduck.jpg" alt="an animal that appears to cross a turtle and a duck">
        <p>The second animal is an imaginative blend of a turtle and a duck. It has the body shape and shell of a turtle,
             complete with detailed, textured patterns on the shell. The limbs are robust and scaled, similar to a turtle's,
              but the head and neck are unmistakably those of a duck. The duck's beak is prominently yellow, and the face is 
              covered in soft, downy feathers. The overall appearance is both whimsical and endearing, with the creature sitting 
              serenely on a lily pad in a tranquil pond, blending the serene qualities of a turtle with the playful charm of a duck.</p>
        <h3>Spider-Penguin</h3>
        <img src="images/spiderpenguin.jpg" alt="an animal that appears to cross a spider and a penguin">
        <p>The third animal is a striking combination of a spider and a penguin. Its body is reminiscent of a spider's, with multiple legs 
            radiating from a central body. Each leg is segmented and covered in what looks like a mix of scales and fur. The creature's body 
            has a rigid, armored appearance, similar to an arachnid. The head, however, is distinctly penguin-like, with a beak, sharp eyes, 
            and a feathered texture. The juxtaposition of a penguin's head on a spider's body creates a surreal and intriguing creature that 
            stands out in a cold, icy environment, surrounded by actual penguins.</p>
        <h3>Raccoon-Whale</h3>
        <img src="images/raccoonwhale.jpg" alt="an animal that appears to cross a racoon and a whale">
        <p>The fourth animal is a captivating hybrid of a raccoon and a whale. The body is primarily that of a raccoon, with its furry texture,
             ringed tail, and distinctive facial mask. However, it possesses the large, powerful flukes of a whale at the back end, allowing it 
             to move gracefully through the water. The creature's fur features both the striped patterns of a raccoon and the smoother, sleek 
             surface associated with marine animals. This blend of terrestrial and aquatic features results in a mesmerizing creature that balances 
             the curiosity and cleverness of a raccoon with the majestic presence of a whale, set against a serene lakeside backdrop.</p>
